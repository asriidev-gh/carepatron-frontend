## Development Summary
1. I've used react-hook-form for the form state and zod for validating form fields
2. react-i18next for managing language
3. Applied theme for future updating of skin and color
4. I also added unit testing using react-testing-library if not constraint I could add E2E testing using cypress
5. I could have added pagination if time is not constraint
6. I could implement redux for state-management if the codebase will grow in the future.
